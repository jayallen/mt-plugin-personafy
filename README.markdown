# Personafy plugin for Movable Type and Melody #

_NOTE: This plugin was built for a very specific purpose and is probably not of any use to anyone other than the intended recipient at this moment.  I will most likely be making it more generic and more widely applicable later on..._

The Personafy plugin freezes the state of the persona field of the entry author's profile into a corresponding entry custom field.  Once set, it persists regardless of changes to the author persona field.  The only time it changes is if the entry changes hands (batch edit, Ghostwriter, etc), at which point it's re-evaluated.
